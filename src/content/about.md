# Hi there

I'm a generally curious person with a wide array of interests (although surface level knowledge in most). In Software Engineering, I'm intrigued by Backend Engineering and DataOps surrounding AI. Currently working as an Associate Software Engineer (de facto lead in projects) at [Techjays](https://www.techjays.com/), where I lead enterprise-level software development initiatives.

## Professional Journey

With a strong foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering from PSG College of Technology, I've evolved into a versatile software engineer. I made some rapid progression at my work thanks to some good mentorship and support. My journey has been marked by significant contributions to both enterprise solutions and open-source projects.

In my current role, I specialize in:

- Building robust backend systems with Python, Django, and FastAPI
- Implementing MLOps and LLMOps solutions
- Developing RAG-based Generative AI applications
- Managing cloud infrastructure on AWS and Azure
- Leading technical initiatives and mentoring junior developers

## Open Source & Community

I'm a strong advocate for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) principles. I've contributed to several notable projects including:

- FastAPI
- Stanford NLP's DSPy
- Chroma DB
- Langchain
- Llamaindex
- Ragas

## Technical Expertise

My core competencies include:

- Backend Development: Python, Django, FastAPI, SQL
- Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- AI/ML: LLMs, MLOps, RAG, PyTorch, Hugging Face
- Tools: Vim, Git, Linux

## Dev Environment

My workflow is centered around Python, so I’ve tailored my environment accordingly. I primarily use Linux (or WSL2 when on Windows). These days, Cursor is my main IDE, but for quick tasks I reach for LazyVim. I really enjoy Vim motions and integrate them into my workflow whenever possible.

## Interests outside Software Development

I regularly watch football and an ardent fan of Real Madrid. I do like reading and would generally explore historical case studies.
